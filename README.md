Depth First Traversals:
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1



Inorder Tree Traversal without recursion and without stack!
4.2
Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion. The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree. In this traversal, we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links, and finally revert the changes to restore original tree.

1. Initialize current as root 
2. While current is not NULL
   If current does not have left child
      a) Print current’s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as right child of the rightmost 
         node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
      
      
      
      
      
      
           1
          /   \
        2      3
      /  \
    4     5

Step 1 Creates an empty stack: S = NULL

Step 2 sets current as address of root: current -> 1

Step 3 Pushes the current node and set current = current->left until current is NULL
     current -> 1
     push 1: Stack S -> 1
     current -> 2
     push 2: Stack S -> 2, 1
     current -> 4
     push 4: Stack S -> 4, 2, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 4: Stack S -> 2, 1
     b) print "4"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 4 */ and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything. 

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 2: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "2"
     c) current -> 5/*right of 2 */ and go to step 3

Step 3 pushes 5 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 5, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 5: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "5"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 5 */ and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 1: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "1"
     c) current -> 3 /*right of 5 */  

Step 3 pushes 3 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 3
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 3: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "3"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 3 */  

Traversal is done now as stack S is empty and current is NULL. 
      
      
      
      
      
Inorder Tree Traversal without Recursion
Using Stack is the obvious way to traverse tree without recursion. Below is an algorithm for traversing binary tree using stack. See this for step wise step execution of the algorithm.

1) Create an empty stack S.
2) Initialize current node as root
3) Push the current node to S and set current = current->left until current is NULL
4) If current is NULL and stack is not empty then 
     a) Pop the top item from stack.
     b) Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right 
     c) Go to step 3.
5) If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.
      
       

       Let us consider the below tree for example

            1
          /   \
        2      3
      /  \
    4     5

Step 1 Creates an empty stack: S = NULL

Step 2 sets current as address of root: current -> 1

Step 3 Pushes the current node and set current = current->left until current is NULL
     current -> 1
     push 1: Stack S -> 1
     current -> 2
     push 2: Stack S -> 2, 1
     current -> 4
     push 4: Stack S -> 4, 2, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 4: Stack S -> 2, 1
     b) print "4"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 4 */ and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything. 

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 2: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "2"
     c) current -> 5/*right of 2 */ and go to step 3

Step 3 pushes 5 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 5, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 5: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "5"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 5 */ and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 1: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "1"
     c) current -> 3 /*right of 5 */  

Step 3 pushes 3 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 3
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 3: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "3"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 3 */  

Traversal is done now as stack S is empty and current is NULL. 





Morris traversal for Preorder
3.8
Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion. The algorithm for Preorder is almost similar to Morris traversal for Inorder.

1...If left child is null, print the current node data. Move to right child.
….Else, Make the right child of the inorder predecessor point to the current node. Two cases arise:
………a) The right child of the inorder predecessor already points to the current node. Set right child to NULL. Move to right child of current node.
………b) The right child is NULL. Set it to current node. Print current node’s data and move to left child of current node.
2...Iterate until current node is not NULL.
